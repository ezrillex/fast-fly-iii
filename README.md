# Fast Fly III

Having to switch hand positions and type a lot of information for stuff like buying a soft drink at the corner store is repetitive and not thrilling. This app is an attempt at solving that issue by reducing the amount of taps required to record mundane transactions by offering template transactions to be sent to the firefly server with just a couple of taps.

Prototype unsigned apk available in Releases.
